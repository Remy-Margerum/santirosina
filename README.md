## Editing

Every page is plain HTML — edit and push to `main`; the workflow deploys automatically.
Design tokens live at the top of `assets/css/style.css`.

## Placeholders to replace before/at launch

- `hello@santirosina.com` — set up this mailbox (or change the address in all pages)
- Tasting-room address, phone, hours (contact page + landing "Visit" strip)
- Instagram handle on the contact page (currently text-only)
- About-page story copy is intentional filler
- Wine list on the shop page is illustrative
- `MMXXVI` / "© 2026" in footers if the launch year changes

## Going live on santirosina.com

DNS stays at Cloudflare; only the records change. Zero-downtime order:

1. Site is already live at the github.io preview URL — approve it first.
2. **GitHub** → repo **Settings → Pages → Custom domain** → enter `santirosina.com` → Save.
3. **Cloudflare DNS** for santirosina.com — remove existing `A`/`AAAA`/`CNAME` records on `@` and `www` that point at the old hosting, then add (all **DNS only** / grey cloud):
   - `A @ 185.199.108.153`
   - `A @ 185.199.109.153`
   - `A @ 185.199.110.153`
   - `A @ 185.199.111.153`
   - `CNAME www remy-margerum.github.io`
   - Leave MX/TXT (email) records untouched.
4. Back in GitHub Pages settings, wait for the DNS check ✓ and the certificate, then tick **Enforce HTTPS**.
5. Optional hardening: GitHub account **Settings → Pages → Verified domains** → verify `santirosina.com` (adds a TXT record at Cloudflare).

Rollback at any time: restore the old Cloudflare records.
